### Development
Morality and Its Origins

- Discusses two contrasting views on morality: one suggesting we are born immoral (Hobbes, Freud) and another proposing we are inherently good (Rousseau).
- Highlights the impact of culture on moral development, including issues like prejudice and racism.

Continuity Between Children and Adults

- Examines the relationship between childhood behavior and adult personality, suggesting **early traits** can predict later outcomes.
- Mentions studies indicating that interviews with young children can forecast their future behaviors and relationships.

Cognitive Development Perspectives

- Introduces three views on cognitive development: **empiricism** (learning from experience), **nativism** (innate structures), and **constructivism** (a blend of both).
- Emphasizes that learning is complex and involves interaction with the environment, rather than just accumulating information.

### Development Psychologists: **Jean Piaget**
Understanding Jean Piaget

- Piaget is recognized as the founder of **modern developmental psychology**, emphasizing the development of knowledge in humans.
- He viewed children as active thinkers, likening them to "little scientists" who construct understanding through experiences.

Key Concepts: Schemas, Assimilation, and Accommodation

- Schemas are **mental frameworks** that help individuals acquire knowledge.
- Assimilation involves **integrating new information into existing schemas**, while accommodation refers to **modifying schemas to incorporate new experiences**.

Stages of Cognitive Development

- Piaget proposed that children's thinking evolves through distinct stages, each characterized by different reasoning styles.
- His approach contrasts with other theories, as he believed children's theories of the world differ significantly from adults' understanding.
### Four stage
**Sensorimotor** Stage (0-2 years)

- Infants learn through **sensory experiences** and motor activities, **lacking reasoning and understanding of object permanence**.
- Object permanence is achieved when children realize that objects continue to exist even when out of sight.

Pre-operational Stage (2-7 years)

- Children begin to **reason** and understand object permanence but are **egocentric**, unable to see perspectives other than their own.
- They also **struggle with the concept of conservation**, believing that quantity changes with the arrangement of objects.

Concrete Operational Stage (7-11 years)

- Children develop logical thinking and overcome egocentrism, but still have difficulty with **abstract reasoning**. 
- They can perform operations mentally but may not yet understand scientific reasoning or hypothetical situations.

Formal Operational Stage (11 years and up)

- Individuals reach full cognitive maturity, capable of abstract and hypothetical reasoning.
- Piaget believed that everyone progresses through these stages naturally, without the influence of external pressures.
### Evaluation
Piaget's Falsifiable Claims

- Piaget's theories are considered falsifiable 可证伪, meaning they can be tested and potentially disproven.
- His work has inspired generations of **developmental psychologists** to explore and refine his ideas.

Limitations of Piaget's Theory

- Theoretical Limitations: Piaget's concepts of assimilation and accommodation lack **clarity** on how these processes lead to developmental changes.
- Methodological Limitations: Piaget's reliance on interviews with children may not accurately capture their cognitive abilities due to their limited verbal skills.

Modern Perspectives on Infant Cognition

- Recent research suggests that children, even infants, may possess greater cognitive abilities than Piaget originally proposed.
- This shift in understanding challenges the historical view of babies as lacking intelligence, highlighting their potential for smarter thinking

### Methods for studying infants
Methods for Understanding Infant Cognition

- **Neuroscientific Techniques**: Researchers use brain scanning technology to observe infants' brain activity while they engage with stimuli.
- **Behavioral Methods**: Infants' sucking behavior and eye movements are monitored to infer their preferences and understanding, such as distinguishing between their mother's voice and a stranger's.

Understanding the Physical World

- **Object Permanence**: Studies show that infants can infer the existence of hidden objects, indicating they understand that objects continue to exist even when out of sight.
- **Expectations and Surprises**: Infants look longer at unexpected events, suggesting they have expectations about how the world works, such as gravity and object solidity.

Numerical and Social Understanding

- **Numerical Skills**: Experiments demonstrate that infants as young as six months can perform basic addition and subtraction, **indicating a rudimentary understanding of numbers**.
- **Social Preferences**: Research indicates that infants show a **preference for characters that exhibit kind behavior**, suggesting an innate sense of morality.

### How are children different from adults?
Understanding Children's Knowledge

- Children possess significant knowledge about the physical and social world but also exhibit limitations in their understanding.
- A key aspect of development is recognizing that children may not grasp concepts that adults find intuitive.

Social Reasoning in Children

- An experiment with a three-year-old, Jacob, shows that he does not understand that the "mean monkey" can be deceived about which sticker is desired.
- In contrast, an 18-month-older child, Patrick, demonstrates an understanding that others can have different thoughts and beliefs.

False Beliefs and Development

- Children under the age of four or five struggle to comprehend that others can hold false beliefs.
- The Sally & Anne test illustrates this concept, where children incorrectly predict where Sally will look for her marble, indicating a lack of understanding of others' perspectives.

### Explanations for development
 Neural Changes in Development

- Development involves pruning of neural connections, leading to fewer but more efficient connections in the brain.
- The myelin sheath around neurons develops over time, affecting brain function and maturity, particularly in the frontal lobes. 额叶

Cognitive Development Theories

- Piaget's theory suggests that **children think differently from adults**, which explains their failure in tasks like conservation.
- Susan Carey compares children's conceptual changes to scientific revolutions, indicating profound shifts in understanding as they grow.

Modular View of Development

- An alternative theory posits that the brain has specific modules for different cognitive functions, which develop along unique trajectories.
- Autism is discussed as a case study for this modular view, suggesting a **damaged social reasoning module in individuals with autism**.
