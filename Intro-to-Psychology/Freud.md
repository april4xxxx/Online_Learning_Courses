Freud's Character and Controversy
- Freud is recognized as a **pivotal intellectual figure** but is also disliked for his ambitious and sometimes **brutal character**.
- His views challenged the perception of humans as rational beings, particularly regarding sexuality and morality.

Key Concepts of Freud's Theories
- Freud introduced the idea of unconscious motivation, suggesting that **our feelings and actions are influenced by unconscious reasons**.
- He proposed that the mind consists of three parts: the id (instinctual desires), the ego (conscious self), and the super-ego (moral conscience), which often conflict with each other.

The Role of the Unconscious
- Freud argued that many of our motivations and desires are **unconscious**, leading to behaviors we may not fully understand.
- Everyday experiences, such as unexplained attractions or forgetfulness, can illustrate the influence of the unconscious mind.

Conflict within the Mind
- The id seeks **immediate** gratification, while the ego tries to satisfy desires realistically, and the super-ego imposes moral standards.
- This internal conflict shapes our behavior and decision-making, often leading to feelings of guilt or shame based on societal norms.

Stages of Psychosexual Development
- **Oral Stage (0-1 year)**: Pleasure centers on the mouth; issues with breastfeeding can lead to oral fixation, resulting in dependency or oral habits in adulthood.
- **Anal 肛门 Stage (1-3 years)**: Pleasure focuses on bowel 肠道control; improper toilet training can lead to anal fixation, manifesting as compulsiveness 强迫症 or stinginess in adults.
- **Phallic 生殖器 Stage (3-6 years)**: Pleasure shifts to the genitals; the Oedipus 俄狄浦斯 Complex arises, where boys desire their mothers and view their fathers as rivals, leading to identification with the father.

Later Stages and Fixation
- **Latency 潜伏 Period (6-puberty)**: Sexual feelings are repressed, allowing focus on hobbies and friendships.
- **Puberty 青春期**: Sexual feelings reemerge, and healthy adults find pleasure in relationships, while fixated 固执的 individuals struggle with unresolved issues from earlier stages.

Defense Mechanisms
- Freud identifies various defense mechanisms that help the ego manage unacceptable desires from the Id, such as displacement, where feelings are redirected to more **acceptable** targets.
- Other mechanisms include **sublimation**, which channels unacceptable desires into socially acceptable activities; and **projection** 投射, where individuals attribute their own unacceptable ashamed feelings to others to reduce anxiety, because ones own shameful feelings are unacceptable; **rationalization** 合理化, where people have certain anxiety-producing thoughts and reason them away into more acceptable ways.

Hysteria and Symptoms
- Freud describes hysteria as **symptoms** that arise when impulses are not properly **repressed**, manifesting in physical symptoms like paralysis or amnesia 失忆.
- He believes these symptoms are ways to keep forbidden thoughts and memories hidden, and that recovering these memories can lead to **catharsis** 宣泄, or emotional release.

Psychoanalytic Techniques
- Freud initially used hypnosis 催眠 to access repressed memories but later developed free association, allowing patients to express thoughts without censorship.
- This method aims to uncover inner conflicts and provide insights into the mind, which is a key aspect of psychoanalysis 心理分析.

Freud's Theory of Dreams
- Freud proposed that dreams serve as a form of wish fulfillment, distinguishing between the latent (true meaning) and manifest (remembered) content of dreams.
- He systematized dream interpretation and linked it to broader themes in literature and mythology, suggesting that these narratives reflect unconscious desires.

Scientific Evaluation of Freud's Theories
- Theories can be rejected for being incorrect or too vague to test; Karl Popper emphasized the importance of falsifiability 可伪造的 in distinguishing science from non-science.
- Claims that can be tested and potentially proven false are considered scientific, while **vague** claims, like horoscopes 星座, lack this quality.

Critique of Freudian Theory
- Freud's theories are often criticized for being **unfalsifiable**, relying heavily on **anecdotal** evidence and lacking clear criteria for validation.
- Some scholars have attempted to reformulate Freudian ideas into testable claims, but the effectiveness of psychoanalysis remains debated.
