Understanding Language
- Language is a central aspect of human cognition and is essential for explaining theories about the mind.
- Various disciplines, including philosophy and psychology, contribute to understanding language, making it a critical area of study.

Defining Language
- The lecture emphasizes a specific definition of language, referring to systems like English, Dutch, and Mandarin, rather than broader forms of communication.
- Clarity in terminology is important for scientific discussions about language learning and brain encoding.

Language Universality
- All human societies possess language, indicating that it is a **universal trait** among humans.
- Unlike other human skills, such as baking or writing, language is **instinctive** and **natural**, as suggested by Charles Darwin.

Creolization and Language Development
- Creolization occurs when children exposed to a pidgin 混杂语言 language transform it into a fully developed language, known as a creole.
- This phenomenon highlights the innate ability of children to create complex language systems from **rudimentary** communication.

Cognitive Aspects of Language
- Language is characterized by creativity, allowing for the generation of an infinite number of sentences.
- Understanding language involves abstract, unconscious rules that enable comprehension and production of new sentences, rather than mere memorization.

Understanding Morphology 
- Morphology **studies the structure and formation of words**, emphasizing the arbitrary nature of language as described by Ferdinand de Saussure.
- The relationship between sounds (like "dog") and their meanings is arbitrary, allowing languages to refer to an infinite number of concepts.

Morphemes vs. Words
- A morpheme is the **smallest unit of meaning**, while words can be formed by combining morphemes.
- Understanding morphemes helps in deciphering new words; for example, knowing "dog" and the plural morpheme "-s" allows one to understand "dogs."

Language Productivity
- Some languages, like German or Hebrew, exhibit more productivity in word formation through morphology compared to English.
- The ability to create and understand new words reflects a significant cognitive capacity in humans.

Vocabulary Knowledge
- Estimating the number of words or morphemes an average English speaker knows is complex, but estimates suggest around 8,000 words for a high school graduate.
- This vocabulary acquisition occurs rapidly, with individuals learning about 10 new words daily from ages one to seventeen.

Understanding Syntax
- Syntax involves a set of symbols (words or phrases) and rules that order these symbols, allowing for the creation of sentences.
- Wilhelm von Humboldt described this as "infinite use of finite media," highlighting the recursive nature of language.

Nativism vs. Learning
- Noam Chomsky's nativism suggests that language development is **innate** and akin to the growth of a bodily organ.
- While there are universal patterns in language, learning from the environment and social interactions is also crucial.

Phonology, Morphology, and Syntax
- Language acquisition involves learning phonetic distinctions (e.g., L vs. R in English), word meanings (e.g., dog vs. chien), and syntax (e.g., sentence structure).
- Children learn these aspects through exposure rather than explicit teaching or feedback.

Stages of Language Development
- Newborns show a **preference for their native language** and can initially distinguish all phonemes.
- By around one year, children begin to speak their first words and understand basic word order.
- Language learning becomes more challenging after a critical period, with age affecting fluency in second languages.
