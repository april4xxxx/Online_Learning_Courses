# The Brain
- Understand Phineas Gage’s story and its significance
	- Break the brain will change our life
- Understand the “astonishing hypothesis” that our mental life is the product of our physical brain
- Understand Descartes’ concept of dualism 二元论, identify the strengths of this view, and then explain why modern scientists have abandoned it
	- I think therefore I am.
- Understand the different parts and functions of a neuron![[Pasted image 20250705144440.png]]
	- Axon 轴突
	- Myelin sheath 髓鞘
	- Dentrite 树突
- Know the different types of neurons and their specific
- Understand how neurons communicate with one another
	- Gap between axon terminal and dentrite is synapse 突触![[Pasted image 20250705144820.png]]
- Know about the different subcortical structures and what they do
	- Spine 脊髓
	- In the center
	- Medulla 髓质 autonomic functions: heartbeat, breathing, blood pressure, swallowing, etc.
	- Cerebellum 小脑 complicated skilled motor movements, mental and sensory tasks, automation of tasks
	- Hypothalamus 下丘脑 hunger, thirst, sleep, body temperature, regulation of homeostatic functions
- Know the different lobes of the cerebral cortex and their functions![[Pasted image 20250705145828.png]]
	- Occipital lobe: vision
	- Temporal lobe: sound
	- The size of the brain areas correspond to which there's motor or sensory functions. ![[Pasted image 20250705150010.png]]
- Understand and distinguish different problems than can arise from brain damage, including apraxia 失用症, agnosia 认不出，心盲, sensory neglect 感觉不到外界, aphasia 失语症, acquired psychopathy 丧失道德或者控制自己的能力
- Understand the concept of lateralization and contralateral organization
	- Two parts communication through corpus callosum 胼胝体
- Distinguish the functions of the right hemisphere from the left hemisphere
	- ![[Pasted image 20250705151326.png]]Sensory information is sent to opposite hemisphere crossing over in pathways leading to cortex
	- Motor crossover: right hemisphere controls left side, left hemisphere controls right side
	- Visual crossover: left eye to right hemisphere, right eye to left hemisphere



# Reading：[Research Designs \| Noba](https://nobaproject.com/modules/research-designs) 
**Influence on Cognitive Psychology:**
- Cognitive psychology revived the study of mental processes, but with scientific methods. The structuralists’ focus on the elements of thought and the functionalists’ interest in mental processes both contributed to the development of cognitive psychology, which studies how people perceive, remember, and solve problems.
## Learning Objectives
- Articulate the difference between correlational and experimental designs.
- Understand how to interpret correlations.
- Understand how experiments help us to infer causality.
- Understand how surveys relate to correlational and experimental research.
- Explain what a longitudinal study is.
- List a strength and weakness of different research designs.

#### Experimental Research
The independent variable is the one **under the experimenter’s control**, or the variable that is intentionally altered between groups. The **dependent** variable is the variable that is not **manipulated** at all, or the one where the effect happens.

[[random assignment]]: participants don't get to pick the condition 【like we choose MN users to interview randomly at first】
