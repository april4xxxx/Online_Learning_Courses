	- Break the brain will change our life
- Understand the “astonishing hypothesis” that our mental life is the product of our physical brain
- Understand Descartes’ concept of dualism 二元论, identify the strengths of this view, and then explain why modern scientists have abandoned it
	- I think therefore I am.
- Understand the different parts and functions of a neuron![[Pasted image 20250705144440.png]]
	- Axon 轴突
	- Myelin sheath 髓鞘
	- Dentrite 树突
- Know the different types of neurons and their specific
- Understand how neurons communicate with one another
	- Gap between axon terminal and dentrite is synapse 突触![[Pasted image 20250705144820.png]]

	- Spine 脊髓
	- In the center
	- Medulla 髓质 autonomic functions: heartbeat, breathing, blood pressure, swallowing, etc.
	- Cerebellum 小脑 complicated skilled motor movements, mental and sensory tasks, automation of tasks
	- Hypothalamus 下丘脑 hunger, thirst, sleep, body temperature, regulation of homeostatic functions
- Know the different lobes of the cerebral cortex and their functions![[Pasted image 20250705145828.png]]
	- Occipital lobe: vision
	- Temporal lobe: sound
	- The size of the brain areas correspond to which there's motor or sensory functions. ![[Pasted image 20250705150010.png]]

	- Two parts communication through corpus callosum 胼胝体
- Distinguish the functions of the right hemisphere from the left hemisphere
	- ![[Pasted image 20250705151326.png]]Sensory information is sent to opposite hemisphere crossing over in pathways leading to cortex
	- Motor crossover: right hemisphere controls left side, left hemisphere controls right side
	- Visual crossover: left eye to right hemisphere, right eye to left hemisphere



### Reading：[History of Psychology \| Noba](https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#content) 
Empiricism from John Locke
Helmholtz’s neural studies
Wilhelm Wundt, German physician, physiologist, and philosopher

**Major Movements and Figures** 
- **Structuralism**: Sought to identify the elements of consciousness through introspection.
- **Functionalism**: Emphasized the adaptive purposes of mind and behavior, influenced by Darwin.
- **Gestalt Psychology**: Argued that the mind perceives wholes, not just parts.
- **Behaviorism**: Championed by Watson and Skinner, focused on observable behavior and learning, rejecting introspection.
- **Cognitive Psychology**: Emerged in the mid-20 th century, returning focus to mental processes like memory, perception, and problem-solving, often using computer analogies. 

**Applied and Professional Psychology** 
- Psychology quickly found practical applications: intelligence testing (Binet, Terman), industrial/organizational psychology (Gilbreth), clinical psychology (Witmer), and more.
- The profession formalized with organizations like the APA and the development of training standards, especially after WWII, leading to the scientist-practitioner and practitioner-scholar models.

**Name some ways in which psychology began to be applied to the general public and everyday problems.** 

- **Intelligence Testing:** [Alfred Binet](ask://ask/Who+was+Alfred+Binet) developed tests to identify children needing educational support, later adapted in the U.S. by [Lewis Terman](ask://ask/Who+was+Lewis+Terman).
- **Industrial/Organizational Psychology:** Psychologists like [Lillian Gilbreth](ask://ask/Who+was+Lillian+Gilbreth) improved workplace efficiency and employee selection.
- **Clinical Psychology:** [Lightner Witmer](ask://ask/Who+was+Lightner+Witmer) founded the first psychological clinic, applying psychological principles to help children with learning and behavioral problems.
- **Advertising and Marketing:** Psychologists studied consumer behavior to improve advertising effectiveness.
- **Military and Education:** Psychological testing and training were used in the military and schools to address practical problems.

**Influence on Cognitive Psychology:**
- Cognitive psychology revived the study of mental processes, but with scientific methods. The structuralists’ focus on the elements of thought and the functionalists’ interest in mental processes both contributed to the development of cognitive psychology, which studies how people perceive, remember, and solve problems.
