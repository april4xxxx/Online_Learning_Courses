# Reading：[Research Designs \| Noba](https://nobaproject.com/modules/research-designs) 
**Influence on Cognitive Psychology:**
- Cognitive psychology revived the study of mental processes, but with scientific methods. The structuralists’ focus on the elements of thought and the functionalists’ interest in mental processes both contributed to the development of cognitive psychology, which studies how people perceive, remember, and solve problems.
## Learning Objectives
- Articulate the difference between correlational and experimental designs.
	- Correlational research can only show that two variables are related, not that one causes the other.
	- Participants are randomly assigned to different conditions, which allows researchers to make causal inferences—meaning they can say that one variable causes changes in another.
- Understand how experiments help us to infer causality.
	- Experiments help us infer causality by manipulating variables and using random assignment to control for other factors.
- Understand how surveys relate to correlational and experimental research.
	- **Surveys** are tools for gathering information from many people efficiently and at low cost.
	- They are most commonly used in correlational research, where researchers look for relationships between variables based on participants’ responses.
	- However, surveys can also be used in experiments. For example, researchers might manipulate what participants read in a survey and then measure their responses to see if the manipulation had an effect (making it an experiment).
- List a strength and weakness of different research designs.

| Research Design    | Strength                                        | Weakness                                                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Experimental       | Can infer causality                             | May be impractical, expensive, or unethical                     |
| Correlational      | Studies natural relationships between variables | Cannot determine causality                                      |
| Qualitative        | Provides rich, detailed insights                | Limited generalizability; potential for researcher bias         |
| Quasi-Experimental | Useful when random assignment isn’t possible    | Harder to infer causality due to pre-existing group differences |
| Longitudinal       | Reveals changes and patterns over time          | Time-consuming; risk of participant dropout (attrition)         |


#### Experimental Research
The independent variable is the one **under the experimenter’s control**, or the variable that is intentionally altered between groups. The **dependent** variable is the variable that is not **manipulated** at all, or the one where the effect happens.

[[random assignment]]: participants don't get to pick the condition 【like we choose MN users to interview randomly at first】, which is critical to experimentation because the only different variable is the independent variable.

#### Other considerations
1. Avoid [[confound]], which are things that could undermine ability to draw causal inferences, known as a [[placebo effect]]. 
2. [[participant demand]] occurs when participants try to behave in a way they think the experimenter wants them to behave.【like in MN, if we ask the interviewers questions about our products, they will say sth that over their reality experience】
3. [[participant expectations]] also influence the outcome of the study.

#### Correlational Designs
When scientists passively observe and measure phenomena.
We identify patterns of relationships, but we usually cannot infer what causes what. 

#### Qualitative Designs
Includes [[participant observation]], [[case study]], [[narrative analysis]].

#### Quasi-experimental Designs
A quasi-experimental design is similar to experimental research, except that random assignment to conditions is not used.
