Behaviorism Overview
- Skinner built upon existing ideas in psychology, particularly those of John Watson, to develop a comprehensive theory known as Behaviorism.
- He emphasized that all human behavior is shaped by experiences rather than innate traits, suggesting that individuals are highly **adaptable**.

Key Principles of Behaviorism
- Anti-Mentalism: Behaviorists advocate for a **scientific** approach, focusing on **observable behaviors** rather than internal mental states, which they consider unscientific.
- Learning Across Species: Skinner proposed that the principles of learning are **consistent** across different species.
- **environmental** factors are the primary influence on behavior.

Habituation Explained
- Habituation is defined as a **decreasing response** to familiar stimuli due to **repeated** exposure.
- It allows individuals to focus on **new** and potentially important stimuli 刺激 rather than familiar ones.

Importance of Habituation
- This mechanism helps in survival by **directing attention** to novel events that may indicate changes in the environment.
- An example is provided where a person becomes accustomed to background noise but **reacts to new sounds**.

**Classical Conditioning**
- Classical conditioning is the learning of **an association between a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus**.
- Ivan Pavlov's experiment with dogs illustrates this concept, where a bell (neutral stimulus) was paired with food (unconditioned stimulus) to elicit salivation 唾液 (conditioned response).![[Pasted image 20250707171317.png]]

Key Components of Classical Conditioning
- Neutral Stimulus: Initially does not evoke a response (e.g., the bell).
- Unconditioned Stimulus and Response: The food naturally elicits a response (salivation) without prior learning.

Learning Process
- Conditioning occurs through repeated **pairings of the neutral stimulus and unconditioned stimulus**, transforming the neutral stimulus into a **conditioned stimulus** that elicits a **conditioned response**.
- Reinforced trials strengthen the association, while unreinforced trials weaken it, leading to extinction of the response.

Applications and Implications
- Classical conditioning can explain various behaviors, including the development of phobias 恐惧 and cravings.
- It also has therapeutic 治疗 applications, such as systematic desensitization 脱敏 for treating phobias by associating feared stimuli with relaxation techniques.
