Behaviorism Overview
- Skinner built upon existing ideas in psychology, particularly those of John Watson, to develop a comprehensive theory known as Behaviorism.
- He emphasized that all human behavior is shaped by experiences rather than innate traits, suggesting that individuals are highly **adaptable**.

Key Principles of Behaviorism
- Anti-Mentalism: Behaviorists advocate for a **scientific** approach, focusing on **observable behaviors** rather than internal mental states, which they consider unscientific.
- Learning Across Species: Skinner proposed that the principles of learning are **consistent** across different species.
- **environmental** factors are the primary influence on behavior.

Habituation Explained
- Habituation is defined as a **decreasing response** to familiar stimuli due to **repeated** exposure.
- It allows individuals to focus on **new** and potentially important stimuli 刺激 rather than familiar ones.

Importance of Habituation
- This mechanism helps in survival by **directing attention** to novel events that may indicate changes in the environment.
- An example is provided where a person becomes accustomed to background noise but **reacts to new sounds**.

**Classical Conditioning**
- Classical conditioning is the learning of **an association between a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus**.
- Ivan Pavlov's experiment with dogs illustrates this concept, where a bell (neutral stimulus) was paired with food (unconditioned stimulus) to elicit salivation 唾液 (conditioned response).![[Pasted image 20250707171317.png]]

Key Components of Classical Conditioning
- Neutral Stimulus: Initially does not evoke a response (e.g., the bell).
- Unconditioned Stimulus and Response: The food naturally elicits a response (salivation) without prior learning.

Learning Process
- Conditioning occurs through repeated **pairings of the neutral stimulus and unconditioned stimulus**, transforming the neutral stimulus into a **conditioned stimulus** that elicits a **conditioned response**.
- Reinforced trials strengthen the association, while unreinforced trials weaken it, leading to extinction of the response.

Applications and Implications
- Classical conditioning can explain various behaviors, including the development of phobias 恐惧 and cravings.
- It also has therapeutic 治疗 applications, such as systematic desensitization 脱敏 for treating phobias by associating feared stimuli with relaxation techniques.

Instrumental Conditioning Overview
- It involves learning which **actions lead to rewards or punishments**, **shaping** future behavior based on these outcomes.
- Unlike classical conditioning, which is passive, operant conditioning is **active** and based on individual actions.

Key Theorists and Concepts
- [[Edward Thorndike]] established the theoretical foundations, demonstrating that animals learn through trial and error rather than sudden insight, exemplified by his puzzle box experiments with cats.
- [[Edward Thorndike]] 's **Law of Effect** states that behaviors followed by rewards are more likely to be repeated, while those followed by punishment are less likely.

Reinforcement and Shaping
- B.F. Skinner expanded on [[Edward Thorndike]] 's work, introducing **reinforcement** types: **positive (adding a desirable stimulus)** and **negative (removing an aversive stimulus)**.
- Skinner's shaping technique involves rewarding **successive** approximations of a desired behavior, gradually **guiding** the subject toward the target action.

Schedules of Reinforcement
- Different reinforcement schedules (fixed vs. variable, ratio vs. interval) affect learning and behavior persistence.
- Partial reinforcement can lead to more **enduring** behaviors, as subjects may continue the behavior in **anticipation** of future rewards. **Gambling**

Application of Behaviorism
- The principles of operant conditioning can be applied to both animal training and human behavior modification, suggesting that society could use these techniques to promote positive behaviors and reduce negative ones.

Behaviorism's Core Claims
- Behaviorists argue that there is no innate knowledge and that learning mechanisms apply universally across species.
- They promote anti-mentalism, suggesting mental processes can be explained solely through stimulus-response principles.

Critiques of Behaviorism
- Evidence shows that different animals have unique learning mechanisms, contradicting behaviorist claims.
- Noam Chomsky's critique of B.F. Skinner's work highlights that behaviorism fails to adequately explain complex human behaviors, such as creativity and self-talk.

Legacy of Behaviorism
- Despite its shortcomings, behaviorism has contributed to understanding learning mechanisms like habituation and conditioning.
- It has provided valuable tools for training and teaching, but it underestimates the complexity of human mental life.
- Understand the main challenges to behaviorism
- Understand the concept of latent learning and why it is a problem for behaviorism
- Articulate Noam Chomsky primary criticisms of behaviorism
