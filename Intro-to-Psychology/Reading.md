**Major Movements and Figures** 
- **Structuralism**: Sought to identify the elements of consciousness through introspection.
- **Functionalism**: Emphasized the adaptive purposes of mind and behavior, influenced by Darwin.
- **Gestalt Psychology**: Argued that the mind perceives wholes, not just parts.
- **Behaviorism**: Championed by Watson and Skinner, focused on observable behavior and learning, rejecting introspection.
- **Cognitive Psychology**: Emerged in the mid-20th century, returning focus to mental processes like memory, perception, and problem-solving, often using computer analogies. 

**Applied and Professional Psychology** 
- Psychology quickly found practical applications: intelligence testing (Binet, Terman), industrial/organizational psychology (Gilbreth), clinical psychology (Witmer), and more.
- The profession formalized with organizations like the APA and the development of training standards, especially after WWII, leading to the scientist-practitioner and practitioner-scholar models.

**Name some ways in which psychology began to be applied to the general public and everyday problems.** 

- **Intelligence Testing:** [Alfred Binet](ask://ask/Who+was+Alfred+Binet) developed tests to identify children needing educational support, later adapted in the U.S. by [Lewis Terman](ask://ask/Who+was+Lewis+Terman).
- **Industrial/Organizational Psychology:** Psychologists like [Lillian Gilbreth](ask://ask/Who+was+Lillian+Gilbreth) improved workplace efficiency and employee selection.
- **Clinical Psychology:** [Lightner Witmer](ask://ask/Who+was+Lightner+Witmer) founded the first psychological clinic, applying psychological principles to help children with learning and behavioral problems.
- **Advertising and Marketing:** Psychologists studied consumer behavior to improve advertising effectiveness.
- **Military and Education:** Psychological testing and training were used in the military and schools to address practical problems.

**Influence on Cognitive Psychology:**
- Cognitive psychology revived the study of mental processes, but with scientific methods. The structuralists’ focus on the elements of thought and the functionalists’ interest in mental processes both contributed to the development of cognitive psychology, which studies how people perceive, remember, and solve problems.
